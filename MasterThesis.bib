abstract = {Objective: Family caregivers can, at times, add complexity to clinical encounters. Difficult family caregivers and dynamics may: derail consultation communication, reduce patient autonomy, and compromise effective clinical care. A paucity of practical strategies guiding effective clinician-family communication exists. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the first comprehensive, evidence-based guidelines (the TRIO guidelines) for oncology physicians and nurses to better manage several complex/challenging situations involving family members. Methods: TRIO Guidelines were based on a comprehensive review of literature, relevant guidelines, and feedback from an expert advisory group (n = 10). Draft guidelines underwent two rounds of evaluation via an online Delphi consensus process involving international experts (n = 35). Results: Guidelines incorporate topic areas, strategies, and sub-strategies on managing challenging family involvement (7 topics). Example wording, behaviours and level of evidence are provided. Conclusion: Challenging triadic interactions require skillful navigation, and the TRIO Guidelines provide clear, specific, and evidence-based strategies for clinicians to utilise in these potentially stressful encounters. Training based on these guidelines may improve both patient care and clinician confidence. Practice implications: Implementation of these guidelines into medical/nursing curricula and as a component of continuing professional development programs will likely be highly beneficial.},

abstract = {Objective: Family caregivers regularly attend medical consultations and are often involved in decision-making; however, there are few practical strategies to guide effective communication for the clinician-patient-family trio. We aimed to develop and evaluate the first comprehensive guidelines for oncology physicians and nurses, on how to positively and effectively involve family caregivers of adult patients in consultations and patient care (TRIO Guidelines-1) and how to manage challenging interactions with family caregivers (TRIO Guidelines-2). Methods: The TRIO Guidelines were based on a comprehensive literature review and input from an expert advisory group (n = 10). They underwent two rounds of formal evaluation via an online Delphi consensus process involving international experts (n = 35), and a subset were piloted with 24 breast cancer clinicians in a workshop format. Results: TRIO Guidelines-1 incorporate strategies and sub-strategies on facilitating collaborative and effective family involvement (6 topics). Example wording, behaviours, and level of evidence are provided throughout. All 24 clinicians rated the guidelines as helpful after the pilot workshop. Conclusion: These guidelines will be a useful educational tool for clinicians and medical/nursing students. Practice implications: By equipping clinicians with strategies to facilitate effective and collaborative family engagement, the TRIO Guidelines have the potential to transform communication in clinical practice.},

abstract = {This article provides a status report on the global burden of cancer worldwide using the GLOBOCAN 2018 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, with a focus on geographic variability across 20 world regions. There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6{\%} of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4{\%} of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6{\%}), prostate cancer (7.1{\%}), and colorectal cancer (6.1{\%}) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2{\%}), stomach cancer (8.2{\%}), and liver cancer (8.2{\%}) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high-quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence-based cancer control programs, are not available in most low- and middle-income countries. The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development is an international partnership that supports better estimation, as well as the collection and use of local data, to prioritize and evaluate national cancer control efforts.

abstract = {Background: Adequate information-provision forms a crucial component of optimal cancer care. However, information-provision is particularly challenging in an oncology setting. It is therefore imperative to help oncological health care practitioners (HCP) optimise their information-giving skills. New forms of online education, i.e. e-learning, enable safe and time and location independent ways of learning, enhancing access to continuous learning for HCP. As part of a user-centred approach to developing an e-learning to improve information-giving skills, this study aims to: 1) uncover the learning needs of oncological healthcare providers related to information- provision, and 2) explore their training preferences in the context of clinical practice. Methods: Focus groups and interviews were organised with oncological HCP (medical specialists and clinical nurse specialists) addressing participants' learning needs concerning information- provision and their training preferences with respect to a new digital training tool on this issue. All sessions were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. Using an inductive approach, transcripts were independently coded by three researchers and discussed to reach consensus. Main themes were summarised and discussed. Results: Four focus group sessions (total n = 13) and three interviews were conducted. The first theme concerned the patient outcomes HCP try to achieve with their information. We found HCP to mainly strive to promote patients' understanding of information. The second theme concerned HCP reported strategies and challenges when trying to inform their patients. These entailed tailoring of information to patient characteristics, structuring of information, and dealing with patients' emotions. Regarding HCP training preferences, an e-learning should be neatly connected to clinical practice. Moreover, participants desired a digital training to allow for feedback on their own (videotaped) information-giving skills from peers, communication experts, and/or patients; to monitor their progress and to tailored the training to individual learning needs. Conclusions: An e-learning for improvement of information-giving skills of oncological HCP should be aimed at the transfer of skills to clinical practice, rather than at enhancing knowledge. Moreover, an e-learning is probably most effective when the facilitates individual learning needs, supports feedback on competence level and improvement, and allows input from significant others (experts, peers, or patients).},

abstract = {Objective This systematic review aims to examine the roles of family members (FMs) in treatment decision-making for adult patients without cognitive or psychiatric disorders affecting their ability to participate in decision-making. Methodology A comprehensive, systematic search of the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed and ScienceDirect databases, with relevant keywords, was conducted. Two authors evaluated the eligibility of the studies independently, then cross-checked for accuracy. The quality of included studies were assessed using standardized criteria. Results Out of the 12.137 studies identified, 40 were included. Results highlighted the different roles and influences FMs have in the decision-making process. Moreover, several factors ranging from personal to cultural and family-related factors influence their level of involvement. Regardless of the illness, some similarities in family influence exist (e.g., social support). However, the type of family involvement varies according to the illness, the treatment choice and the patients' culture. Conclusion FMs have an important role in the decision-making process. In fact, the final decision is often made by the patients after consulting their families. FMs can support both patients and medical teams, and thus facilitate the process. Practice implications Physicians should include FMs in treatment decision-making when the patients and their FMs wish to be included.},

abstract = {Modern research has broadened scientific knowledge and revealed the interdisciplinary nature of the sciences. For today's students, this advance translates to learning a more diverse range of concepts, usually in less time, and without supporting resources. Students can benefit from technology-enhanced learning supplements that unify concepts and are delivered on-demand over the Internet. Such supplements, like imaging informatics databases, serve as innovative references for biomedical information, but could improve their interaction interfaces to support learning. With information from these digital datasets, multimedia learning tools can be designed to transform learning into an active process where students can visualize relationships over time, interact with dynamic content, and immediately test their knowledge. This approach bridges knowledge gaps, fosters conceptual understanding, and builds problem-solving and critical thinking skills - all essential components to informatics training for science and medicine. Additional benefits include cost-free access and ease of dissemination over the Internet or CD-ROM. However, current methods for the design of multimedia learning modules are not standardized and lack strong instructional design. Pressure from administrators at the top and students from the bottom are pushing faculty to use modern technology to address the learning needs and expectations of contemporary students. Yet, faculty lack adequate support and training to adopt this new approach. So how can faculty learn to create educational multimedia materials for their students? This paper provides guidelines on best practices in educational multimedia design, derived from the Virtual Labs Project at Stanford University. The development of a multimedia module consists of five phases: (1) understand the learning problem and the users needs; (2) design the content to harness the enabling technologies; (3) build multimedia materials with web style standards and human factors principles; (4) user testing; (5) Evaluate and improve design. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Objective: To systematically review quantitative and qualitative studies exploring physician-adult patient-adult companion (triadic) communication and/or decision-making within all medical encounters. Methods: Studies were identified via database searches and reference lists. One author assessed eligibility of studies, verified by two co-authors. Data were extracted by one author and cross-checked for accuracy. Two authors assessed the quality of included articles using standardized criteria. Results: Of the 8409 titles identified, 52 studies were included. Summary statements and tables were developed for each of five identified themes. Results indicated companions regularly attended consultations, were frequently perceived as helpful, and assumed a variety of roles. However, their involvement often raised challenges. Patients with increased need were more often accompanied. Some companion behaviours were felt to be more helpful (e.g. informational support) and less helpful (e.g. dominating/demanding behaviours), and preferences for involvement varied widely. Conclusion: Triadic communication in medical encounters can be helpful but challenging. Based on analysis of included studies, preliminary strategies for health professionals are proposed. Practice implications: Preliminary strategies for health professionals include (i) encourage/involve companions, (ii) highlight helpful companion behaviours, (iii) clarify and agree upon role preferences of patient/companions. Future studies should develop and evaluate specific strategies for optimizing triadic consultations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Recent changes in healthcare management generally and in cancer care in particular, indicate a major shift in the clinical management of cancer from hospitals and healthcare professionals (HCPs) to patients and families. In light of these changes national and international policies and reports by the Department of Health and Children (2001, 2006) and the World Health Organisation (2004) have recommended that HCPs support family members (FMs) to care for loved ones. The purpose of this review therefore was to explore the extent to which FMs' needs are realised by HCPs in practice. Objectives: To examine recent research (2000-2010) in relation to; the type of information that FMs of patients with cancer generally seek, how they seek this information from HCPs, and, FMs' experiences of communicating with HCPs in this context. Methods: A review of the literature was conducted using key databases Medline, Pub med, Psych-Info and CINAHL. Results: Thirty four papers were included in the review. Overall the studies demonstrated that FMs of patients with cancer have similar information needs and demonstrate similar strategies for seeking information. While many FMs report positive communication experiences with HCPs and have information needs met, the majority of FMs report negative communication encounters with HCPs. Conclusion: HCPs are highly significant in the lives of FMs of patients with cancer. The review concludes with identifying; FMs most wanted information needs, their struggles with accessing HCPs and the type of communication encounters FMs most desire to have with HCPs. Recommendations for education, practice and research are addressed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Conclusion: Partners are often involved in triadic clinical consultations that have implications for treatment-related decision making. Most studies offered general descriptions but lacked detailed investigation of communicative processes in triads and how these may operate with partners vs. other companions. Practice implications: Existing studies lack detailed investigation through direct observation of the processes of partner involvement. Research in other areas of clinical communication suggests that future interventions could be informed by attention to the following areas: partner behaviour vs. other companion types in triads; relationships between partner involvement and decision-making processes; partner involvement in triads vs. other groups (e.g. quadratic).},

This paper was designed to research about the different factors and drivers that could influence students' behaviour into the usage of mobile technologies for learning. The methodology was based on a quantitative survey grounded on the Technology Acceptance Model and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. Data were collected from medical students in University of Coimbra. This model pointed to a behaviour pattern based on the experience and application by medical students, correlating with a strong attitude towards using mobile technology for learning (57{\%}) and willingness to recommend it (40.5{\%}). In line with previous studies, Social Influence raised to be an important factor towards the Attitude and Behavioural Intention of using Mobile Learning. In addition, according to the results, the student's ease of perception seems to be the main factor affecting the Social Influence (31.9{\%}) and the reliability for recommending this technology for learning was the main factor that affected the Behavioural Intention. Findings provide support for Technology Acceptance Model and the implications of these findings are discussed within the context of Innovation in Education.},

abstract = {Objective Family caregivers are regularly involved in cancer consultations and treatment decision-making (DM). Yet there is limited conceptual description of caregiver influence/involvement in DM. To address this, an empirically-grounded conceptual framework of triadic DM (TRIO Framework) and corresponding graphical aid (TRIO Triangle) were developed. Methods Jabareen's model for conceptual framework development informed multiple phases of development/validation, incorporation of empirical research and theory, and iterative revisions by an expert advisory group. Results Findings coalesced into six empirically-grounded conceptual insights: i) Caregiver influence over a decision is variable amongst different groups; ii) Caregiver influence is variable within the one triad over time; iii) Caregivers are involved in various ways in the wider DM process; iv) DM is not only amongst three, but can occur among wider social networks; v) Many factors may affect the form and extent of caregiver involvement in DM; vi) Caregiver influence over, and involvement in, DM is linked to their everyday involvement in illness care/management. Conclusion The TRIO Framework/Triangle may serve as a useful guide for future empirical, ethical and/or theoretical work. Practice implications This Framework can deepen clinicians's and researcher's understanding of the diverse and varying scope of caregiver involvement and influence in DM.},

abstract = {Unlike professional caregivers such as physicians and nurses, informal caregivers, typically family members or friends, provide care to individuals with a variety of conditions including advanced age, dementia, and cancer. This experience is commonly perceived as a chronic stressor, and caregivers often experience negative psychological, behavioral, and physiological effects on their daily lives and health. In this report, we describe the experience of a 53-yearold woman who is the sole caregiver for her husband, who has acute myelogenous leukemia and was undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. During his intense and unpredictable course, the caregiver's burden is complex and complicated by multiple competing priorities. Because caregivers are often faced with multiple concurrent stressful events and extended, unrelenting stress, they may experience negative health effects, mediated in part by immune and autonomic dysregulation. Physicians and their interdisciplinary teams are presented daily with individuals providing such care and have opportunity to intervene. This report describes a case that exemplifies caregiving burden and discusses the importance of identifying caregivers at risk of negative health outcomes and intervening to attenuate the stress associated with the caregiving experience. {\textcopyright}2012 American Medical Association.

A meta-analysis was conducted with 21 independent samples of cancer patients and their carers, to quantify the relationship and difference between respective measures of psychological distress. Correlation coefficients and standard differences were extracted from 21 studies that met pre-defined inclusion criteria. Random effects models were used. Variables that modified this relationship were examined with potential causes of heterogeneity explored. Analysis confirmed the positive association between patient and carer psychological distress (r=0.35, P{\textless}0.0001), and indicated that patients and carers did not experience significantly more or less psychological distress than one another (P=0.64). Subgroup analysis was performed to explore potential sources of heterogeneity, and initial findings indicated a relationship between time since diagnosis and the strength of correlation between patient and carer psychological distress. The meta-analysis was limited by the large clinical and methodological variability between studies, and further systematic prospective research is required. This preliminary evidence suggests that early intervention with the patient and their carer could prevent later development of psychological distress in both members. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

E-learning technologies offer learners control over content, learning sequence, pace of learning, time, and often media, allowing them to tailor their experiences to meet their personal learning objectives. In diverse medical education contexts, e-learning appears to be at least as effective as traditional instructor-led methods such as lectures. Students do not see e-learning as replacing traditional instructor-led training but as a complement to it, forming part of a blended-learning strategy. A developing infrastructure to support e-learning within medical education includes repositories, or digital libraries, to manage access to e-learning materials, consensus on technical standardization, and methods for peer review of these resources. E-learning presents numerous research opportunities for faculty, along with continuing challenges for documenting scholarship. Innovations in e-learning technologies point toward a revolution in education, allowing learning to be individualized (adaptive learning), enhancing learners' interactions with others (collaborative learning), and transforming the role of the teacher. The integration of e-learning into medical education can catalyze the shift toward applying adult learning theory, where educators will no longer serve mainly as the distributors of content, but will become more involved as facilitators of learning and assessors of competency.},
